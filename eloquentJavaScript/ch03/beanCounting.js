/**
 * You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N) , similar
 * to how you get its length with "s".length . The returned value will be a string containing only
 * one character (for example, "b" ). The first character has position zero, which causes the last
 * one to be found at position string.length - 1 . In other words, a two-character string has length
 * 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1. Write a function countBs that takes a string as its
 * only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the
 * string. Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs , except it takes a
 * second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only
 * uppercase "B" characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
