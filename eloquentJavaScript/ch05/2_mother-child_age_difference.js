/**
 * Mother-child age difference:
 * 	- Using the example data set from this chapter, compute the average age difference
 * 		between mothers and children (the age of the mother when the child is born). You
 * 		can use the average function defined earlier in this chapter.
 * 	- Note: that not all the mothers mentioned in the data are themselves present in the
 * 					array. The byName object, which makes it easy to find a person’s object from
 * 					their name, might be useful here.
