/**
 * To compute the sum of a range of numbers: console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
 * Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all
 * the numbers from start up to (and including) end.
 * Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run
 * the previous program and see whether it does indeed return 55.
 * As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates
 * the “step” value used to build up the array. If no step is given, the array elements go up by increments
 * of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
 * Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].
