/**
 * Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline
 * characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
 * or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board. Passing this string to
 * console.log should show something like this:
 *
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *
 * When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and
 * change the program so that it works for any size , outputting a grid of the given width
 * and height.
